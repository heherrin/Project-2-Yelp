# Project-2-Yelp
For the second project we decided to use YELP API to explore the difference in taste, favorite food and quality of food in some of the most important cities in the US.
Using Python, connected to the API and pandas to create a dataframe with 1000 restaurants from 20+ cities.
Also connected python to postgresql to load the dataframe into a table in a new database.
Then created and app to have the information from the database available to create visualization using javascript.
Once we were able to load our dataset to JavaScript we created a page with three interactive graphs using Plotly. One to compare the restaurantâ€™s categories by city by rating and other to analyze which cities have the most and least restaurants by rating. 
And last, we created an interactive map using Leaflet to see where the restaurants are located with the option of filtering by rating,
